# Face Detection

## Objective : 

This is the first part of the whole project. In this part of the project contains code for detection of human face. This part is done for a reason to get hands-on on the various libraries used for face detection and how these concepts and algorithms can be used further for the human detection.

## Working : 

1. Here embeddings are created which helps in creating our own dataset for live human face detetction.
2. The individual ID and name has to be given as input to every human in frame which is stored in ref_name.pkl file.
3. Run embeddings.py file which creates face embeddings and stores them in ref_embed.pkl file.
4. Next run recognition.py file.
